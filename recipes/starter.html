        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ small red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>8 medium tomatoes (about 500g), coarsely chopped and drained</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
            <li>6-8 leaves of fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
            <li>30ml balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>60-80ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 loaf crusty baguette</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, gently combine onions, tomatoes, garlic, and basil—be careful not to crush the tomatoes! Drizzle with balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Mix well, cover, and chill for at least an hour to let the flavors meld beautifully.</li>
            <li>Slice the baguette diagonally into 12 thick pieces and toast until golden on both sides. Spoon the flavorful mixture onto the warm bread and serve immediately. Prefer it at room temperature? Simply take it out of the fridge 30 minutes before serving.</li>
          </ol>
