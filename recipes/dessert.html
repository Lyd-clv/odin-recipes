        <p>This banana bread is naturally sweetened with the goodness of fruit, and for an extra touch of sweetness, you can drizzle a little agave syrup. <br> That means you will need far less added sugar, making it a healthier, delicious treat!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed
            </li><li>125g wholemeal flour</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>75g sultana</li>
            <li>50g butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla essence</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
           <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
           <li>lidrizzle agave syrup, to serve (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan) or gas mark 4. Grease and line a 450g (1lb) loaf tin with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Weigh the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and sultanas into a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon. In another bowl or jug, weigh the butter, vanilla essence, egg, milk, and mashed bananas, and mix with a small balloon whisk or fork. Pour the banana mixture into the dry ingredients and stir well with a wooden spoon. Make sure the weighing is accurate—older kids can measure carefully, while younger ones can help spoon or pour ingredients with supervision. Younger children can also beat the egg and mash the banana.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Let it cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with agave syrup if desired.</li>
          </ol>
